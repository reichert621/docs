### Ensuring idempotency

Booper also features an option to ensure **idempotency**, meaning we can set a key that is used to enforce uniqueness.

In other words, if we want to send a product update email to Jane and make sure it's only sent _once_, we could set the `idempotency_key` to some combination of Jane's unique ID with the product update version (e.g. `janes-user-id.product-update-v1.3.27`) to force any future scheduled emails with the same `idempotency_key` to be ignored.
