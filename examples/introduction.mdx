### Getting started

Most of the examples are written in TypeScript/JavaScript, using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) or [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for defining custom API routes.

We also include links to [Replit](https://replit.com/) where possible, so you can edit and run the code easily in the browser.
