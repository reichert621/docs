To authenticate you need to add an **Authorization** header with the contents of the header being `Bearer sk_123456789` where `sk_123456789` is your [API Key](https://www.booper.dev/api-keys).

```
'Authorization': 'Bearer <API key>'
```

## API keys

You can get a private API key by signing up for a [free account](https://www.booper.dev/register).

When using your API key, be sure to store it in an environment variable, and avoid checking it into your source control.

### Public API key

If you just want to try things out without signing up, you can use our [public API key](https://www.booper.dev/g/home).

Note that any jobs you create with the public API key will be viewable and editable by anyone, so be sure not to use it for anything private or important.
